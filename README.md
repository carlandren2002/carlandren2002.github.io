**Digitalizing Home Care for the Elderly**  

This project was aimed at improving existing market solutions for digitalizing home care services for the elderly, which were often outdated and had cumbersome user experiences. Conducted at Chalmers, I was solely responsible for the UX and UI design, focusing on modernizing the interface and workflow to reduce the day-to-day tedium for home care workers. My approach prioritized making information easily accessible and organizing it according to an intuitive hierarchy, ensuring that caregivers could focus more on care and less on navigating the software.


## 2D/3D Animation

**Stylized Character and Environment Animation**

This project was an individual endeavor where I collaborated closely with a client to create a visually appealing animation. I utilized Duik Bassel 2 in Adobe After Effects for the character rigging and animation, ensuring smooth and lifelike character movements. For the environments, I incorporated Cinema 4D to develop rich, stylized 3D settings that complement the characters. The combination of these advanced tools allowed me to achieve a professional and aesthetically stylized look that met the client's specific needs and vision.

**Simplified Product Demonstration Through 3D Visualization**

In this project, my objective was to clearly and simply visualize a client's new product, elucidating its functionality and benefits. Starting from basic images of the product, I created detailed 3D models and developed a sleek, straightforward video that effectively demonstrated how the product works. This approach not only enhanced the product's appeal but also helped the client effectively communicate its value to potential customers. The client was extremely pleased with the result, highlighting the video's role in enhancing product understanding and boosting customer engagement.
